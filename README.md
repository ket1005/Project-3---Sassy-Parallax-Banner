# Project-3---Sassy-Parallax-Banner
Parallax scrolling is a popular web design trend that gained momentum in recent years! If you’ve ever noticed a background moving at a slower rate than the foreground, creating a 3D effect and adding depth, then you’ve seen parallax scrolling. The sleek traveling agency Travels-R-Us has reached out to you to launch their new “Visit Myanmar” page. They have requested a page that implements a parallax banner so that the user may scroll and admire travel photography as they decide where to take their next trip. After some research, you decide nesting, variables, and mixins will be the best tools to style a parallax banner.
